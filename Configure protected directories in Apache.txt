xFusionCorp Industries has hosted some static websites on Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos DC. 
There are some confidential directories on document root that need to be password protected. 
Since they are using Apache for hosting the websites so the production support team has decided to use .htaccess with basic auth. 
There is a website that needs to be uploaded to /var/www/html/security on Nautilus App Server 2. 
But before that we need to setup the authentication.


1.Create /var/www/html/security directory if doesn't exist.

2.Add an user anita in htpasswd and set its password to YchZHRcLkL.

3.There is a file /tmp/index.html placed on Jump Server. Copy the same to new directory you created, 
please make sure default document root should remain /var/www/html.

  
FIRST WE NEED TO MOVE INDEX.HTML FROM JUMP TO APPLICATION SERVER THROUGH SCP    (scp index.html steve@stapp02:~)
    1  sudo -i
    2  sudo systemctl start httpd
    3  sudo systemctl enable httpd
    4  sudo systemctl status httpd
    5  cd /var/www/html/
    6  ls
    7  sudo vi .htaccess
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Secure Content"
  AuthUserFile /var/www/html/security/.htpasswd
  require valid-user

    8  ls -la
    9  sudo mkdir security
   10  ls
   11  cd
   12  sudo mv index.html /var/www/html/security/
   13  ls
   14  sudo htpasswd -c /var/www/html/security/.htpasswd anita
       password:YchZHRcLkL
       retype password:YchZHRcLkL
   15  cd /etc/httpd/conf/
   16  sudo vi httpd.conf

AllowOverride none (or) ALL --> AllowOverride AuthConfig       ----IN /VAR/WWW/HTML DIRECTORY U WILL FIND .HTACCESS NAME

   17  cd /var/www/html/
   18  sudo systemctl restart httpd
   19  sudo curl http://localhost:8080
   20  sudo curl http://localhost:8080 -u anita
