There are specific access levels for users defined by the xFusionCorp Industries system admin team. Rather than providing access levels to every individual user, the team has decided to create groups with required access levels and add users to that groups as needed. See the following requirements:


a. Create a group named nautilus_admin_users in all App servers in Stratos Datacenter.

b. Add the user stark to nautilus_admin_users in all App servers. (create the user if not present already)

ssh tony@stapp01 'echo "rootpass" | sudo -Sv && bash -s' < my_script.sh stark nautilus_admin_users
ssh steve@stapp02 'echo "rootpass" | sudo -Sv && bash -s' < my_script.sh stark nautilus_admin_users
ssh banner@stapp03 'echo "rootpass" | sudo -Sv && bash -s' < my_script.sh stark nautilus_admin_users
    
my_scrpt.sh
===========

    #!/bin/bash
    if [ !(grep $1 /etc/passwd)]
      then
        adduser $1
    fi    
    if [ !(grep $2 /etc/group)]
      then
        groupadd $2
        usermod -a -G $2 $1
    fi
    if [(grep $1 /etc/passwd) && (grep $2 /etc/group) && (grep $1 (grep $2 /etc/group))
      then
        echo "success"
    fi
