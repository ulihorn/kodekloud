The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy 
a new application on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. 
They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. 
Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:


1.Install and configure nginx on App Server 2.

2.On App Server 2 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present 
at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. 
Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

3.Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.

4.For final testing try to access the App Server 2 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. 
For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.



  
ROOT

    1  yum update -y # This takes too long.
    2  yum install epel-release nginx mod_ssl -y
    3  yum install epel-release nginx mod_ssl -y # need to do this twice because of dependencies
    4  systemctl start nginx
    5  systemctl enable nginx
    6  systemctl status nginx
        
    8  unlink /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html           # WHEN I UNLINKED INDEX.HTML IS REMOVED AUTOMATTICALLY THEN I CREATED NEWONE AS PER QUESTION(3)
    9  vi /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html               # In this change to Welcome! #IN THIS I ADD Welcome!
   10  cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html              # confirm file contents and location
   11  cat /tmp/nautilus.crt
   12  cat /tmp/nautilus.key
   13  chmod 400 nautilus.key
   14  cp /tmp/nautilus.* /etc/pki/tls/certs/
   15  ls -la /etc/pki/tls/certs/                      # UPTO HERE CRT&KEY FILE COPIED TO APPROPRIATE LOCATION (COPY OR MOVE YOUR WISH)
   16  ip a   # Get ip address
   17  vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   
    # delete existing "server" section contents and replace with the following ensure that server name has the correct ip address
    server {

   18  systemctl restart nginx
   19  curl localhost # test on local machine
   20  curl -k https://172.16.238.11/ # Test on local machine Should be Welcome!
   21  # Test on jump_host. See below:
