The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons 
and want their data to be strictly accessed by the dbadmin group of the team.

Setup a collaborative directory /dbadmin/data on Nautilus App 1 server in Stratos Datacenter.

The directory should be group owned by the group dbadmin and the group should own the files inside the directory. 
The directory should be read/write/execute to the group owners, and others should not have any access.

sudo -i
    # check if dbadmin and/or dbadmin group exist
mkdir -p /dbadmin/data
ls -la /dbadmin/data
chgrp dbadmin /dbadmin/data
ls -la /dbadmin/data
chmod 770 /dbadmin/data
ls -la /dbadmin/data
