There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 1 at /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. 
Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there. 
Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. 
Find the details below:

On App Server 1 find all files (not directories) owned by user siva inside /home/usersdata directory and 
copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /official directory.

# This question is ambiguous. The use copy when I suspect they mean move. It's not clear what filter out means. Lets assume they mean move the files
sudo -i
find /home/usersdata -type f -user siva | xargs -I % cp --parents % /official # Test to see if files seem correct.
ls -la /official 
find /home/usersdata -type f -user siva | xargs -I % rm % # remove files from original location
