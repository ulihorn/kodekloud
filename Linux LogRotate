The Nautilus DevOps team is ready to launch a new application, which they will deploy on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
They are expecting significant traffic/usage of httpd on app servers after that. 
This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. 
To utilise the storage efficiently, they need to compress the log files and retain them for a maximum of 3 weeks. 
Check the requirements shared below:

a. In all app servers install httpd package.

b. Using logrotate configure httpd logs rotation to monthly and keep only 3 rotated.

(If by default log rotation is set, then please update configuration as needed)

yum install haproxy logrotate -y
vi /etc/logrotate.conf

      1 # see "man logrotate" for details
      2 # rotate log files weekly
      3 weekly
      4 
      5 # keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
      6 rotate 4
      7 
      8 # create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
      9 create
     10 
     11 # use date as a suffix of the rotated file
     12 dateext
     13 
     14 # uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
     15 #compress
     16 
     17 # RPM packages drop log rotation information into this directory
     18 include /etc/logrotate.d
     19 
     20 # no packages own wtmp and btmp -- we'll rotate them here
     21 /var/log/wtmp {
     22     monthly
     23     create 0664 root utmp
     24         minsize 1M
     25     rotate 1
     26 }
     27 
     28 /var/log/btmp {
     29     missingok
     30     monthly
     31     create 0600 root utmp
     32     rotate 1
     33 }
