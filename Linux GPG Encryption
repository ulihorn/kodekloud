We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.
We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. 
Use those keys to perform the following actions.

    Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.

    Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).

gpg --list-keys
gpg --import public_key.asc
gpg --list-keys # lists kodekloud@kodekloud.com
gpg --armor --output encrypted_me.asc -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --encrypt encrypt_me.txt
gpg --encrypt -r kod

gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt
kodekloud 
cat decrypted_me.txt
