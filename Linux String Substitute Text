Task Details

There is some data on Nautilus App Server 2 in Stratos DC. Data needs to be altered in several of the files. 
On Nautilus App Server 2, alter the /home/BSD.txt file as per details given below:

a. Delete all lines containing word following and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file. (Please be aware of case sensitivity)

Note: Let's say you are asked to replace word to with from. In that case, make sure not to alter any words containing this string; 
for example upto, contributor etc.

sudo -i
cd /home
cat BSD.txt | wc -l  # get number of lines in file
grep "following" BSD.txt # look at lines containing 'following'
grep "following" BSD.txt | wc -l # get number of lines containing 'following' in file

sed '/following/d' BSD.txt > BSD_DELETE.txt # write file without lines containing 'following to new file
cat BSD_DELETE.txt | wc -l # check that number of lines in new file equal number of lines in old file minus number of lines containing 'following'

grep "to" BSD.txt # see if there are any words not 'to' which contain 'to'
grep "to" BSD.txt | wc -l # numbr of lines containing 'to'
grep -w "to" BSD.txt or grep "\<to\>" BSD.txt # show lines containing 'to' as whole word
grep -w "to" BSD.txt | wc -l # number of lines containing 'to' as whole word
sed 's/\<to\>/from/g' BSD.txt > BSD_REPLACE.txt # \< and \> ensure word boundary
grep -w "to" BSD_REPLACE.txt | wc -l # number of lines containing 'to' as whole word should be 0
grep "to" BSD_REPLACE.txt | wc -l # should be the difference between line 23 and line 27
